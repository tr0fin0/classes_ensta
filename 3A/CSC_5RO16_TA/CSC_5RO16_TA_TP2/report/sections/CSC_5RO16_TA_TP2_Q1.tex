\section{Question 1}
% Test the two algorithms RRT and RRT* on this problem by varying the maximum number of iterations. What can you see on the average lengths of the paths ? On the computation times ? Remember to disable the display and to make several experiments to have signiÔ¨Åcant results as these algorithms are stochastic.
