\section{Question 4}
% Modify the code of the ﬁlter to use only the landmark direction in the Kalman correction. Implement a simple undelayed initialization for new landmarks by adding several landmarks along the perception direction with growing covariances. It is not asked to implement the full solution (e.g. the Federated ﬁlter and the map pruning described in [1]). Simply update the most likely hypothesis at each step, and prune the hypothesis whose detection probability is below a threshold. Test the approach in an environment with only one landmark for simplicity (i.e. reproduce the scenario of Fig 1).
