\section{Question 3}
% For this question, keep the conﬁguration with unknown data association (KNOWN_DATA_ASSOCIATION = 0) and an environment with a large loop and a sparse map.
% Change the estimated noise values Q and Py so that they are (1) smaller, (2) equal or (3) larger than the values used for simulation (Q_Sim and Py_Sim). What happens in each case for the ﬁlter performance, the ﬁlter consistency and the map quality? What seems to be the best conﬁguration ?
