%   stimulus coherences
coherence = [0.025 0.05 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.5 0.75];
%   coherence refers to the strength or degree of similarity between the stimuli
%   presented to the neuron:
%       - coherence of 0 indicates that the stimuli are completely dissimilar;
%       - coherence of 1 indicates that the stimuli are identical;

%   coherence increases with the synchronisation of the stimulus.

n_stimulus = numel(coherence);          % number of stimuli

mean_background = 10;                   % background mean spike count
lambda = mean_background + 30*coherence;% mean spike count 
n_trials = 1e3;                         % number of trials

spikes_0 = poissrnd(repmat(mean_background, n_trials, 1));  % generate spikes (0% coherence)
spikes  = poissrnd(repmat(lambda, n_trials, 1));            % generate spikes

%   as spikes_0 has 0% coherence data no spike should be produced by this stimulus



%%  plot histograms

x = 0:50;                   % different spike counts for histogram
edges = [x-0.5,x(end)+1];   % bin edges for histogram

hist_0 = histcounts(spikes_0, edges);            % histogram of spike counts (0% coherence)

%   we can see that the total of stimulus are the same but more spread between 
%   multiple spike counts.

%   more coherence means data closer to a true stimulus so spike count would increase.

%   as consequence the standard deviation of the stimulus would also increase because...



%%  Receiver Operator Characteristic, ROC, curves
%   ===========================================================================

%   according to chatGPT:
%   The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is a graphical 
%   representation of the performance of a binary classifier as the 
%   discrimination threshold is varied. The ROC curve plots the true positive 
%   rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) for different threshold 
%   values. 

%   The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a commonly used metric for 
%   quantifying the overall performance of the classifier, with an AUC of 1.0 
%   indicating perfect classification and an AUC of 0.5 indicating random 
%   classification.

z = 50:-1:0;                                        % thresholds
n_thresholds = numel(z);                            % number of thresholds

false_positive = zeros(n_thresholds, 1);            % false positive rate
true_positive  = zeros(n_thresholds, n_stimulus);   % hit rate

% loop over thresholds
for i = 1:n_thresholds
    false_positive(i)   = mean(spikes_0 > z(i));    % false positive rate
    true_positive(i, :) = mean(spikes  >= z(i));    % hit rate
    % this is a vetorial operation

%   Sensitivity and specificity are measures of the performance of a binary
%   classification test.
% 
%   Sensitivity is the proportion of true positive results (i.e., the
%   proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified as such)
%   in relation to all actual positives. In other words, sensitivity measures
%   how well the test identifies individuals who have the condition being tested for.
% 
%   Specificity, on the other hand, is the proportion of true negative results
%   (i.e., the proportion of actual negatives that are correctly identified as such)
%   in relation to all actual negatives. Specificity measures how well the test
%   identifies individuals who do not have the condition being tested for.
% 
%   Both sensitivity and specificity are usually expressed as percentages,
%   with higher values indicating better test performance.

%   TN: true negatives
%   FN: false negatives
%   FP: false positives

%   question:
%       threshold is represented with the dots on the graph and as it increases,
%       true positive and false positive also increase.

%       increasing the threshold means that a "larger" stimulus, in this case
%       a more coherent stimulus, is necessary to be consider as a real stimulus.

%       therefore the TPR will increase because, on average, every TP has a minimal
%       value of stimulus distinguishable from background noise so when the threshold
%       increases is more likely that if a signal passed that mark it is a stimulus.

%       but if the threshold keeps growning it gets extremely difficult, even for a true
%       stimulus, to a signal to match and therefore the FPR will increase.

%   question:
%       as cohrence increases the overall performance of the estimator also increases,
%       in other words, as TPR increases FPR does not increases as much and smaller
%       threshold values can be selected.

%       in general the ROC curve is very close from what was expected.

%   curves closer to the left upper corner are consider more accuracy, goal
%   is to increase the area below the curve as the AUC performance method sugests

%   corners caracteristics:
%       lower left:
%           - sensitivity:   0%
%           - specificity: 100%
%       upper right:
%           - sensitivity: 100%
%           - specificity:   0%

%%  Area Under Curve, AUC, and 2 Alternative Forced Choice, 2pAFC
%   performance in 2 alternative forced choice experiment 
%   ===========================================================================

%   The AUC provides an aggregate measure of performance across all possible
%   stimulus intensities. The AUC is computed by approximating the integral
%   under the ROC curve using a finite sum.

%   The second measure computed is the probability of correct response in the
%   2AFC experiment (p2AFC). This is simply the proportion of trials where the
%   subject responded correctly.

%   compute area under curve
dalpha = false_positive(2:end)-false_positive(1:end-1);
AUC = dalpha'*true_positive(1:end-1,:);

%   compute error in p2AFC
p2AFC = mean(spikes >= spikes_0);

%   we want to calculate both metrics in order to compare them and see if
%   them correctly represent a good approximation for the data.

%   where MATLAB does a vectorial operation comparing each colun with the
%   spikes_0 column that, in this case, would return boolean values if true or
%   not.

%   calculating the mean would return values between 0 and 1 that represent, 
%   in average, how good this estimator fits our data.

%   The strength of AUC is that it provides a measure of overall performance,
%   taking into account both sensitivity and specificity, and is not affected by
%   changes in the criterion. Moreover, AUC is a continuous measure, which makes
%   it possible to compare performance across different tasks and experimental
%   conditions.

%   On the other hand, AUC has some limitations. First, it does not provide
%   information about the optimal criterion level or the signal-to-noise ratio
%   of the system. Second, it assumes that the cost of false positives and false
%   negatives is equal, which may not be the case in all situations. Finally,
%   AUC requires a large number of trials to estimate accurately, which can be
%   time-consuming and resource-intensive.

%   The strength of 2AFC is that it provides a measure of sensitivity and
%   specificity separately, which can be useful for understanding the underlying
%   mechanisms of the system. 2AFC also has the advantage of being easy to
%   compute and interpret.

%   However, 2AFC also has some limitations. First, it requires the experimenter
%   to choose a criterion level, which can affect the outcome of the analysis.
%   Second, it can be affected by changes in the criterion level, which makes it
%   difficult to compare performance across different tasks and experimental
%   conditions. Finally, 2AFC assumes that the cost of false positives and false
%   negatives is equal, which may not be the case in all situations.


%%  compute entropy for binary stimulus
%   ===========================================================================

%   In information theory, entropy is a measure of the uncertainty or randomness
%   in a random variable. In the context of data, entropy is a measure of the
%   amount of information contained in the data or the degree of randomness in
%   the data.

%   Mathematically, the entropy of a discrete random variable X with possible
%   values {x1, x2, ..., xn} and probability mass function P(X) is defined as:

%       H(X) = -Î£ P(xi) log2 P(xi)

%   where log2 is the base-2 logarithm, and the summation is taken over all
%   possible values of X.

%   The entropy is maximized when all possible values of X are equally likely
%   (i.e., a uniform distribution) and minimized when the distribution is
%   deterministic (i.e., all probability mass is concentrated on a single value
%   of X). The entropy is always non-negative and is measured in bits, nats, or
%   other units depending on the choice of the logarithm base.

p = linspace(0, 1, 1000);                 % probability that x = 1
H =  -p.*log2(p) - (1-p).*log2(1-p);       % entropy

%%  compute mutual information between stimulus and response
%   ===========================================================================

%   Mutual information is a measure of the amount of information that is shared
%   between two variables. In the context of data analysis, mutual information
%   can be used to measure the degree of dependence between two variables. It is
%   defined as the reduction in uncertainty of one variable when the value of
%   the other variable is known.

%   Formally, let X and Y be two random variables with probability distributions
%   p(x) and p(y), respectively. The mutual information I(X;Y) between X and Y
%   is defined as:

%   I(X;Y) = â<sub>x,y</sub> p(x,y) log<sub>2</sub> [p(x,y) / (p(x) * p(y))]

%   where the summation is taken over all possible values of X and Y. The mutual
%   information measures the amount of information that X and Y share in common.
%   A higher mutual information value indicates a stronger dependence between
%   the two variables.

%   In the context of data analysis, mutual information can be used to identify
%   patterns and relationships between variables, and to determine which
%   variables are most informative for predicting the value of another variable.

%   log p(x)
logpx = -repmat(log(n_stimulus), 1, n_stimulus);

%   maximum firing rate
rmax = 100;

%   log p(spikes|x)
logpr_x = zeros(rmax+1, numel(coherence));
for k = 0:rmax
    logpr_x(k+1, :) = k*log(lambda) - lambda - gammaln(1+k);
end

%   compute p(spikes, x)
prx = exp(logpr_x+logpx);

%   compute p(spikes)
pr = sum(prx, 2);

% compute HR
HR = - pr(:)'*log(pr(:));

% compute HR_X
HR_X = - prx(:)'*logpr_x(:);

% compute mutual information
mutual_info = HR - HR_X;

fprintf('\n neuron encodes %.3f nats\n', mutual_info)

%   In information theory, a nat is a unit of information or entropy, based
%   on the natural logarithm e (approximately 2.71828). It is equivalent to
%   one bit of information entropy if the logarithm is taken to base 2.

%   Specifically, if an event has probability p of occurring, then the
%   information content of that event in nats is -ln(1-p), where ln denotes
%   the natural logarithm. Nats are used as a unit of information in some
%   branches of information theory, especially in the analysis of continuous
%   random variables.


%   question:
%       mutual information may increase with the increase of the rmax value
%       because the resolution of the response probability distribution would
%       also increase.

%       if neurons are more sensitive to high coherences, making more high coherences
%       more likely would increase the mutual information because the change in
%       the probability distribution.
%       it depends on how the conditional entropy of the response is given.
